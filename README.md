# From-Ratings-to-Revenue-Zomato-Dataset-Breakdown
The restaurant industry thrives on customer satisfaction, pricing strategies, and regional preferences, making data-driven insights critical for stakeholders. This project analyzes the Zomato dataset to uncover trends in restaurant ratings, pricing, cuisines, predictive modeling, and geographic distribution.Using Python and its powerful libraries, the analysis addresses
five key objectives:
1. Analyze Restaurant Ratings and Popularity: Investigate the relationship between
aggregate ratings and customer votes to understand popularity drivers.
2. Investigate the Impact of Price Range on Customer Experience: Examine how
price range influences ratings and service availability.
3. Explore Cuisine Preferences Across Cities or Countries: Identify dominant
cuisines in top regions to reveal culinary trends.
4. Predict Restaurant Ratings Using Machine Learning: Build a predictive model for
ratings based on features like price and votes.
5. Geographical Analysis of Restaurant Distribution: Map restaurant locations to
study spatial patterns and their relation to ratings.

By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualizations, this
project aims to provide actionable insights for restaurant owners, marketers, and
policymakers, making complex data accessible and meaningful.
